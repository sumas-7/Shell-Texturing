# Simple Free-Look Camera
A simple 3D 100-line free-look camera for Godot 4.0 that mimics the functionality of the editor's camera for in-game use.

Ported from [Adamviola's Godot 3.2 version](https://github.com/adamviola/simple-free-look-camera).

## Usage
Use **W** and **S** to move forward and backward.

Use **A** and **D** to move left and right.

Use **Q** and **E** to move up and down.

Roll the **scroll wheel** to increase and decrease movement speed.

Press **shift** to move faster, and hold **alt** to move slower.

Hold down the **right mouse button** to rotate the camera.
There's a slider in the editor to control mouse sensitivity.

## Installation
Attach `camera.gd` to your Camera3D node. That's it!
